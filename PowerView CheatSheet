# PowerView CheatSheet

PowerView.ps1 is a powerful domain enumeration tool created by harmj0y. During my CRTP studies, I learned how to leverage this to enumerate AD objects such as user's, computers, domain trusts, GPO's, etc. 

## Commands

#### Enumerate Users
Get-NetUser # get all users of the domain
Get-NetUser | select cn,description # only display the cn and decritption property

#### Enumerate Computers
Get-NetComputer # get all computers on the domain
Get-NetComputer -fulldata # display all properties to each computer object
Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select cn,operatingsystem # display the OS of each computer
